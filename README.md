# Vue Brunch Boilerplate

Boilerplate to use Vue with Brunch. Mostly based on [nblackburn/brunch-with-vue](https://github.com/nblackburn/brunch-with-vue/).
Most of modifications are based of my taste. Be sure to check out the original.

## Instructions

To get started, simply run the following command in your terminal...

```bash
brunch new --skeleton lubien/vue-brunch-boilerplate
```
